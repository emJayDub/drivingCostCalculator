# drivingCostCalculator
A program that returns the cost to drive.

This program promopts the user for a couple of parameters, current gas cost, miles driven, and their vehicle's average MPG. 
Then returns the price per cost of trip

I thought this could be useful for the surging gas costs and the rising rate of inflation, this can act as an aid to assist in budgeting, as well as unexpected adventures.
